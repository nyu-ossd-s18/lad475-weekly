## Overall...

I really enjoyed this course.  It opened my eyes to a new type of programming, where other people can implement the parts of a project that I don't particularly enjoy working on, and I can do the same for others.  I feel like I gained a skill that will give me both some enjoyment (making contributions is fun!) and some experience with my professional pursuits, in terms of being able to apply to jobs and have real open source experience.

I especially felt that I gained a fair amount of knowledge about using git.  I was already using GitHub to program most of my personal and school projects since I program on multiple machines, but I'd always had such difficulty collaborating with others since I was unsure about things such as resolving merge conflicts, rebasing code, and being able to work on seperate branches that are eventually merged together.  
Group work was also something that works very well in this class, and I really enjoyed being able to contribute to Moment.js with my group.  

I think the one thing that I'd like to add to this class is making more documentation fixing contributions from the start.  If we'd had more experience making a few simple pull requests before choosing our projects, I think not only would picking a project be easier, but also getting used to the community behind each project would also be more comfortable to do.

Thanks for a great semester! :)
