## Open Data Week in NYC

This week was a very busy one for all of us, especially with midterms, but I felt that a great part of my week was the information that I learned from some of the Open Data events.  I attended both the NYU BUGS event, as well as the Data Through Design exhibit.

### BUGS Event

The BUGS event at NYU was my favorite of the two events that I attended; I found the speakers to be incredibly knowledgable and informative, and walked out feeling like I was aware of many more things about open data than I had been prior.

Some things that I've never thought about are how we tend not to think about how incorrect open data can be, and how it needs to be spot checked and looked at over and over until the data is good enough to be used.

Honestly, the event in general has inspired me to want to work more with data than I do now; some statistics are so interesting, and I've always thought that good data visualizations can be so powerful and important.

### Data Through Design

Unfortunately, I did not find very much to be appealing about this event.  It was advertised beautifully, with a landing page that gave me the idea that this would be some very cool exhibit with plenty of bells and whistles,  I expected it to be relatively small, but not nearly as small as it was.

A lot of the exhibits lacked proper explanation on how they should be experienced, and some of them seemed to straight up not be working at the time when I looked at them.  The exhibits themselves were right in front of a large group of people at work, and overall it was just a tad bizzare.

There were, however, some shocking and interesting statistics on some of the art that was available, such as a translucent map of car accidents in NYC, lined up against other translucent maps with previous years on them.  They almost lined up to make NYC look like one giant car accident.
