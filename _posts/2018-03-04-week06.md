## Team Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths

Overall, our team seems to have a nice balance in having someone with leadership and group project skills, someone who has worked with Moment and used it in a professional context, and those who are willing, eager, and excited to work on Moment.  I personally feel that I excel in writing code that is easy to understand, nice looking, linted, and is well documented in comments.

### Weaknesses

There is one common worry amoung everyone on our team; we all are a bit wary of working on a large scale project for the first time, and have concerns about our ability, communicating with the community, and lack of guidance from professors or other mentors besides those working on the project.

## Meeting time

Our group plans on meeting from 6-8PM on Thursdays, with an alternative time being anytime on Saturdays.

## Open Data Week!

I plan on attending the NYU BUGS event on Monday night, as well as the Data Through Design art exhibit either Tuesday or Wednesday.
