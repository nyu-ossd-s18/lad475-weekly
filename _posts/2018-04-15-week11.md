## Group Progress

Our progress is coming along swimmingly!  This week we've been all together working on implementing a new feature for moment, in which as time progresses, spans of time get converted to round to nice looking numbers.  This was implemented for many units of time, but not for weeks, so we've been working on adding a weeks variable.

We successfully ended up adding in the weeks, and learned how to write unit tests using grunt.  We wrote in the unit tests for our implementation, and are nearly ready to create a pull request.  

There were some issues we ran into mid-development with how the units of time went from days to weeks to months, but we managed to all look at the code as a team and figured out what detail about how units of time were rounded in the code, and understood what we had originally gotten wrong.

Currently, our unit tests seem to all be passing and returning the correct values.
