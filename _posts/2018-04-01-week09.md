## Questions for Danna

1. How do you feel working on Open Source technologies at a big company like Google affects the future of open source?
2. How accepting of outside of Google contributions is the company on open source Google products?
3. How much of Google do you feel influences open source technologies?

## Progress

We've finally decided on and further pinpointed an issue on Moment- this week we were able to go into the code, and take a look at finding parts that would be beneficial to look at in order to implement a new feature on Moment.  The new feature would involve being able to parse relative periods of time as weeks, since currently relative time only works with other units of time.  The user who asked for this feature to be implemented works with puppies, and would like to display their ages in weeks using moment relative time parsing.

I specifically sought out help with the Moment community, asking to see if anyone could guide us on modifying the code base.  I also helped in looking back at old versions of the code to try and decipher certain segments.

We've decided to get cracking soon, since there are a lot of locale files that will need to be updated for this fix.

## Contributions
TBD, I have to add a couple of things, but have created the file.
